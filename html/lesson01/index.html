<h1>Slipknot (band)</h1>
<p>Slipknot is an American heavy metal band formed in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1995 by percussionist Shawn Crahan, drummer
    Joey Jordison and bassist Paul Gray. After several lineup changes in its early years, the band settled on nine
    members for more than a decade: Crahan, Jordison, Gray, Craig Jones, Mick Thomson, Corey Taylor, Sid Wilson, Chris
    Fehn, and Jim Root. Gray died on May 24, 2010, and was replaced during 2011–2014 by guitarist Donnie Steele.
    Jordison was dismissed from the band on December 12, 2013. Steele left during the recording sessions for .5: The
    Gray Chapter. The band found replacements in Alessandro Venturella on bass and Jay Weinberg on drums. After the
    departure of Jordison, as of December 2013 the only founding member in the current lineup is percussionist Crahan.
    Fehn was also dismissed from the band in March 2019 prior to the writing of We Are Not Your Kind.</p>

<h2>Stage performances</h2>
<p>Slipknot is known for its chaotic, energetic live shows that contributed to the band's success. During
    performances, most of the band's members headbang heavily. The band's early performances included extreme
    acts such as stage dives from high balconies and band members setting each other on fire. Clown was known to go into
    the crowd and tie people up with the microphone cord.In later years, they tended to refrain from acts this
    extreme. Former bassist Paul Gray said this was due to receiving lawsuits and to avoid harming other people, and
    that it was a "better move" for the longevity of the band. Along with the energetic and unpredictable
    performances, Slipknot often use elaborate stage setups that use pyrotechnics, elevated stage areas, hydraulic drum
    risers, and computer screens.Reviewing a Slipknot performance, Alistair Lawrence of Kerrang! said, "the
    choreographed chaos is too multi-faceted to fully describe" and NME described one Slipknot show as "a scene of
    chaos".</p>
